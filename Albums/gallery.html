        <p class="description">Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope.There is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally, in a heartbeat, in a single flashing, throbbing moment.</p>

        <p class="description">Love is not love until love’s vulnerable. Love is a thing that is full of cares and fears. In a society that worships love, freedom and beauty, dance is sacred. It is a prayer for the future, a remembrance of the past and a joyful exclamation of thanks for the present.</p>

        <p class="description">Love is like a beautiful flower which I may not touch, but whose fragrance makes the garden a place of delight just the same.Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up.</p>

          <p class="description">Nobody on earth can ever love you more than your parents. A father's goodness is higher than the mountain, a mother's goodness deeper than the sea. When you look into your mother’s an father's eyes, you know that is the purest love and greatest protection you can find on this earth.</p>

          <p class="description">Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that. Love doesn’t just sit there, like a stone, it has to be made, like bread; remade all the time, made new. Love is the ultimate expression of the will to live. Life is the flower for which love is the honey.</p>
